## Play Dino with hand gesture

This is my first experience with MediaPipe, a powerful framework for applying Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

This demo showcases playing the Dino game using hand gestures. It uses OpenCV for video capture and MediaPipe for hand tracking. The player can make the dinosaur jump by raising their index finger.
