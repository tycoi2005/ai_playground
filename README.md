## Play Dino with hand gesture or jump

This is my first experience with MediaPipe, a powerful framework for applying Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

This demo showcases playing the Dino game using hand gestures or body jump. It uses OpenCV for video capture and MediaPipe for hand or pose tracking. The player can make the dinosaur jump by raising their index finger or jump before camera.

To run script, use command $ python main.py --mode mode

mode:
- hand: control with hand gestures (default)
- pose: control by jumping
